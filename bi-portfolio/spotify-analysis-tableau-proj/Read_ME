Project Purpose/Description:
- The purpose of this project was to pull a dataset by API request, cleanse and manipulate the data in python, and then visualize the data in a BI tool (Tableau).
- The data set was pulled from Kaggle via API request, and consists of metrics on the top Spotify songs of 2023.

  Steps:
1. Pulled a zipfile (top-spotify-songs-2023.zip) of the dataset via Kaggle API request; set the file location for the zip file.
2. Unzipped the file and processed the csv file (spotify-2023.csv) as a pandas df within Python (SpotifyAnalysis.py).
3. Inspected the data set, filled in/removed Nulls, and created a view off of the original dataset to isolate individual artists by track in order to summarize total streams per artist.
4. Wrote the final dataframes to excel (Spotify2023_TableauProj.xlsx)
